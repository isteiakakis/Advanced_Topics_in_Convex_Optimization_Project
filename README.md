# Advanced Topics in Convex Optimization - Solutions

This repository contains my solution implementations for the course "Advanced Topics in Convex Optimization". Each solution demonstrates an algorithm or a concept taught in the course.

## Installation

To run these solutions, you'll need MATLAB installed on your machine. Once you have MATLAB, you can clone this repository using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isteiakakis/Advanced_Topics_in_Convex_Optimization_Project.git
```


## Usage

The solution files are named in the format `Ex*.m`, where `*` represents the exercise number. Each file corresponds to an individual exercise from the course and contains a demonstration of the respective algorithm implemented in that exercise.

To run these files and see the algorithms in action, open them in MATLAB and execute them directly.
